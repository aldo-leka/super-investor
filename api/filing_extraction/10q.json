Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 29,998 $ 34,630\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares outstanding 15,892,723 16,391,724\nEffect of dilutive securities 62,995 127,567\nWeighted-average diluted shares 15,955,718 16,519,291\nBasic earnings per share $ 1.89 $ 2.11\nDiluted earnings per share $ 1.88 $ 2.10\nApproximately 89 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 because their effect would have been antidilutive.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 6\nNote 2 - Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\niPhone® (1)\n$ 65,775 $ 71,628\nMac® (1)\n7,735 10,852\niPad® (1)\n9,396 7,248\nWearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2)\n13,482 14,701\nServices (3)\n20,766 19,516\nTotal net sales (4)\n$ 117,154 $ 123,945\n(1)Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n(2)Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods®, Apple TV®, Apple Watch®, Beats® products, HomePod mini® and accessories.\n(3)Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare®, cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\n(4)Includes $3.4 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022 and $3.0 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 25, 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 9, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.6 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company expects 63% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 27% within one-to-two years, 8% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 7\nNote 3 - Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables show the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment category as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022\nAdjusted\nCost Unrealized\nGains Unrealized\nLosses Fair\nValue Cash and\nCash\nEquivalents Current\nMarketable\nSecurities Non-Current Marketable\nSecurities\nCash $ 17,908 $ - $ - $ 17,908 $ 17,908 $ - $ -\nLevel 1 (1):\nMoney market funds 818 - - 818 818 - -\nMutual funds 330 2 (40) 292 - 292 -\nSubtotal 1,148 2 (40) 1,110 818 292 -\nLevel 2 (2):\nU.S. Treasury securities 24,128 1 (1,576) 22,553 13 9,105 13,435\nU.S. agency securities 5,743 - (643) 5,100 - 310 4,790\nNon-U.S. government securities 17,778 14 (1,029) 16,763 - 9,907 6,856\nCertificates of deposit and time deposits\n2,025 - - 2,025 1,795 230 -\nCommercial paper 237 - - 237 - 237 -\nCorporate debt securities 85,895 14 (7,039) 78,870 1 10,377 68,492\nMunicipal securities 864 - (26) 838 - 278 560\nMortgage- and asset-backed securities\n22,448 3 (2,405) 20,046 - 84 19,962\nSubtotal 159,118 32 (12,718) 146,432 1,809 30,528 114,095\nTotal (3)\n$ 178,174 $ 34 $ (12,758) $ 165,450 $ 20,535 $ 30,820 $ 114,095\nSeptember 24, 2022\nAdjusted\nCost Unrealized\nGains Unrealized\nLosses Fair\nValue Cash and\nCash\nEquivalents Current\nMarketable\nSecurities Non-Current\nMarketable\nSecurities\nCash $ 18,546 $ - $ - $ 18,546 $ 18,546 $ - $ -\nLevel 1 (1):\nMoney market funds 2,929 - - 2,929 2,929 - -\nMutual funds 274 - (47) 227 - 227 -\nSubtotal 3,203 - (47) 3,156 2,929 227 -\nLevel 2 (2):\nU.S. Treasury securities 25,134 - (1,725) 23,409 338 5,091 17,980\nU.S. agency securities 5,823 - (655) 5,168 - 240 4,928\nNon-U.S. government securities 16,948 2 (1,201) 15,749 - 8,806 6,943\nCertificates of deposit and time deposits\n2,067 - - 2,067 1,805 262 -\nCommercial paper 718 - - 718 28 690 -\nCorporate debt securities 87,148 9 (7,707) 79,450 - 9,023 70,427\nMunicipal securities 921 - (35) 886 - 266 620\nMortgage- and asset-backed securities\n22,553 - (2,593) 19,960 - 53 19,907\nSubtotal 161,312 11 (13,916) 147,407 2,171 24,431 120,805\nTotal (3)\n$ 183,061 $ 11 $ (13,963) $ 169,109 $ 23,646 $ 24,658 $ 120,805\n(1)Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n(2)Level 2 fair value estimates are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n(3)As of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, total marketable securities included $13.6 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the European Commission decision finding that Ireland granted state aid to the Company, and other agreements.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 8\nThe following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of December 31, 2022 (in millions):\nDue after 1 year through 5 years $ 82,497\nDue after 5 years through 10 years 14,243\nDue after 10 years 17,355\nTotal fair value $ 114,095\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 20 years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2022 September 24,\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts $ 66,054 $ 102,670\nInterest rate contracts $ 20,125 $ 20,125\nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts $ 134,971 $ 185,381\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 9\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 24, 2022\nFair Value of\nDerivatives Designated\nas Accounting Hedges Fair Value of\nDerivatives Not Designated\nas Accounting Hedges Total\nFair Value\nDerivative assets (1):\nForeign exchange contracts $ 4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136\nDerivative liabilities (2):\nForeign exchange contracts $ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752\nInterest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ - $ 1,367\n(1)Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(2)Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2022 September 24,\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities $ 14,311 $ 13,378\nCurrent and non-current term debt $ (18,731) $ (18,739)\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of both December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 11% and 10%, respectively. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 43% and 44% of total trade receivables as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, respectively.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 16%. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 10\nNote 4 - Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nThe following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):\nInventories\nDecember 31,\n2022 September 24,\nComponents $ 2,513 $ 1,637\nFinished goods 4,307 3,309\nTotal inventories $ 6,820 $ 4,946\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nDecember 31,\n2022 September 24,\nGross property, plant and equipment $ 110,995 $ 114,457\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (68,044) (72,340)\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net $ 42,951 $ 42,117\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nThe following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\nInterest and dividend income $ 868 $ 650\nInterest expense (1,003) (694)\nOther expense, net (258) (203)\nTotal other income/(expense), net $ (393) $ (247)\nNote 5 - Debt\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program.

The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed content and distribution rights. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of December 31, 2022, are as follows (in millions):\n2023 (remaining nine months) $ 2,899\n2024 2,897\n2025 1,584\n2026 6,554\n2027 348\nThereafter 444\nTotal $ 14,726\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.\nQuarterly Highlights\nTotal net sales decreased 5% or $6.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The weakness in foreign currencies contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, which was partially offset by higher net sales of iPad.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Company announced a new iPad, a new iPad Pro® powered by the Apple M2 chip, and a new Apple TV 4K.\nThe Company repurchased $19.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 15\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced, and could in the future experience, disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. During the first quarter of 2023, COVID-related impacts temporarily affected the Company’s primary iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max assembly facility located in Zhengzhou, China. The facility operated at significantly reduced capacity, impacting iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone Pro Max shipments.\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates and currency fluctuations, have direct and indirect impacts on the Company’s business. The Company believes these factors have impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\n2021 Change\nNet sales by reportable segment:\nAmericas $ 49,278 $ 51,496 (4) %\nEurope 27,681 29,749 (7) %\nGreater China 23,905 25,783 (7) %\nJapan 6,755 7,107 (5) %\nRest of Asia Pacific 9,535 9,810 (3) %\nTotal net sales $ 117,154 $ 123,945 (5) %\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services and iPad. The weakness of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on Americas net sales during the first quarter of 2023.\nEurope\nEurope net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 16\nGreater China\nGreater China net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness of the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar. The weakness of the renminbi contributed to lower net sales of iPhone, which was partially offset by higher net sales of iPad.\nJapan\nJapan net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar, which contributed to lower net sales of Services and Mac.\nRest of Asia Pacific\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The weakness in foreign currencies contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, which was partially offset by higher net sales of Services and iPad.\nProducts and Services Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by category for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\n2021 Change\nNet sales by category:\niPhone (1)\n$ 65,775 $ 71,628 (8) %\nMac (1)\n7,735 10,852 (29) %\niPad (1)\n9,396 7,248 30 %\nWearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2)\n13,482 14,701 (8) %\nServices (3)\n20,766 19,516 6 %\nTotal net sales $ 117,154 $ 123,945 (5) %\n(1)Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n(2)Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod mini and accessories.\n(3)Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\niPhone\niPhone net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales from the Company’s new iPhone models launched in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nMac\nMac net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of MacBook Pro®.\niPad\niPad net sales increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to higher net sales of iPad and iPad Air®.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 17\nWearables, Home and Accessories\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of AirPods, partially offset by higher net sales of Watch.\nServices\nServices net sales increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to higher net sales from cloud services, the App Store® and music.\nGross Margin\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\nGross margin:\nProducts $ 35,623 $ 40,120\nServices 14,709 14,123\nTotal gross margin $ 50,332 $ 54,243\nGross margin percentage:\nProducts 37.0 % 38.4 %\nServices 70.8 % 72.4 %\nTotal gross margin percentage 43.0 % 43.8 %\nProducts Gross Margin\nProducts gross margin decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume.\nProducts gross margin percentage decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\nServices Gross Margin\nServices gross margin increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs, partially offset by improved leverage.\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 18\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\nResearch and development $ 7,709 $ 6,306\nPercentage of total net sales 7 % 5 %\nSelling, general and administrative $ 6,607 $ 6,449\nPercentage of total net sales 6 % 5 %\nTotal operating expenses $ 14,316 $ 12,755\nPercentage of total net sales 12 % 10 %\nResearch and Development\nThe growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nThe growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\nProvision for income taxes $ 5,625 $ 6,611\nEffective tax rate 15.8 % 16.0 %\nStatutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 %\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation, and the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to a higher U.S. federal R&D credit, lower state income taxes and a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, largely offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\nThe Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2022 Form 10-K, except for commercial paper and manufacturing purchase obligations.\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.7 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 19\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $55.1 billion, with $54.8 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The share repurchase program (the “Program”) does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2022 Form 10-K.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first three months of 2023. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2022 Form 10-K.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 20",

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 29,998 $ 34,630\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares outstanding 15,892,723 16,391,724\nEffect of dilutive securities 62,995 127,567\nWeighted-average diluted shares 15,955,718 16,519,291\nBasic earnings per share $ 1.89 $ 2.11\nDiluted earnings per share $ 1.88 $ 2.10\nApproximately 89 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 because their effect would have been antidilutive.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 6\nNote 2 - Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\niPhone® (1)\n$ 65,775 $ 71,628\nMac® (1)\n7,735 10,852\niPad® (1)\n9,396 7,248\nWearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2)\n13,482 14,701\nServices (3)\n20,766 19,516\nTotal net sales (4)\n$ 117,154 $ 123,945\n(1)Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n(2)Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods®, Apple TV®, Apple Watch®, Beats® products, HomePod mini® and accessories.\n(3)Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare®, cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\n(4)Includes $3.4 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022 and $3.0 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 25, 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 9, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.6 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company expects 63% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 27% within one-to-two years, 8% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 7\nNote 3 - Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables show the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment category as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022\nAdjusted\nCost Unrealized\nGains Unrealized\nLosses Fair\nValue Cash and\nCash\nEquivalents Current\nMarketable\nSecurities Non-Current Marketable\nSecurities\nCash $ 17,908 $ - $ - $ 17,908 $ 17,908 $ - $ -\nLevel 1 (1):\nMoney market funds 818 - - 818 818 - -\nMutual funds 330 2 (40) 292 - 292 -\nSubtotal 1,148 2 (40) 1,110 818 292 -\nLevel 2 (2):\nU.S. Treasury securities 24,128 1 (1,576) 22,553 13 9,105 13,435\nU.S. agency securities 5,743 - (643) 5,100 - 310 4,790\nNon-U.S. government securities 17,778 14 (1,029) 16,763 - 9,907 6,856\nCertificates of deposit and time deposits\n2,025 - - 2,025 1,795 230 -\nCommercial paper 237 - - 237 - 237 -\nCorporate debt securities 85,895 14 (7,039) 78,870 1 10,377 68,492\nMunicipal securities 864 - (26) 838 - 278 560\nMortgage- and asset-backed securities\n22,448 3 (2,405) 20,046 - 84 19,962\nSubtotal 159,118 32 (12,718) 146,432 1,809 30,528 114,095\nTotal (3)\n$ 178,174 $ 34 $ (12,758) $ 165,450 $ 20,535 $ 30,820 $ 114,095\nSeptember 24, 2022\nAdjusted\nCost Unrealized\nGains Unrealized\nLosses Fair\nValue Cash and\nCash\nEquivalents Current\nMarketable\nSecurities Non-Current\nMarketable\nSecurities\nCash $ 18,546 $ - $ - $ 18,546 $ 18,546 $ - $ -\nLevel 1 (1):\nMoney market funds 2,929 - - 2,929 2,929 - -\nMutual funds 274 - (47) 227 - 227 -\nSubtotal 3,203 - (47) 3,156 2,929 227 -\nLevel 2 (2):\nU.S. Treasury securities 25,134 - (1,725) 23,409 338 5,091 17,980\nU.S. agency securities 5,823 - (655) 5,168 - 240 4,928\nNon-U.S. government securities 16,948 2 (1,201) 15,749 - 8,806 6,943\nCertificates of deposit and time deposits\n2,067 - - 2,067 1,805 262 -\nCommercial paper 718 - - 718 28 690 -\nCorporate debt securities 87,148 9 (7,707) 79,450 - 9,023 70,427\nMunicipal securities 921 - (35) 886 - 266 620\nMortgage- and asset-backed securities\n22,553 - (2,593) 19,960 - 53 19,907\nSubtotal 161,312 11 (13,916) 147,407 2,171 24,431 120,805\nTotal (3)\n$ 183,061 $ 11 $ (13,963) $ 169,109 $ 23,646 $ 24,658 $ 120,805\n(1)Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n(2)Level 2 fair value estimates are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n(3)As of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, total marketable securities included $13.6 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the European Commission decision finding that Ireland granted state aid to the Company, and other agreements.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 8\nThe following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of December 31, 2022 (in millions):\nDue after 1 year through 5 years $ 82,497\nDue after 5 years through 10 years 14,243\nDue after 10 years 17,355\nTotal fair value $ 114,095\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 20 years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2022 September 24,\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts $ 66,054 $ 102,670\nInterest rate contracts $ 20,125 $ 20,125\nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts $ 134,971 $ 185,381\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 9\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 24, 2022\nFair Value of\nDerivatives Designated\nas Accounting Hedges Fair Value of\nDerivatives Not Designated\nas Accounting Hedges Total\nFair Value\nDerivative assets (1):\nForeign exchange contracts $ 4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136\nDerivative liabilities (2):\nForeign exchange contracts $ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752\nInterest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ - $ 1,367\n(1)Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(2)Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2022 September 24,\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities $ 14,311 $ 13,378\nCurrent and non-current term debt $ (18,731) $ (18,739)\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of both December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 11% and 10%, respectively. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 43% and 44% of total trade receivables as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, respectively.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 16%. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 10\nNote 4 - Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nThe following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):\nInventories\nDecember 31,\n2022 September 24,\nComponents $ 2,513 $ 1,637\nFinished goods 4,307 3,309\nTotal inventories $ 6,820 $ 4,946\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nDecember 31,\n2022 September 24,\nGross property, plant and equipment $ 110,995 $ 114,457\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (68,044) (72,340)\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net $ 42,951 $ 42,117\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nThe following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\nInterest and dividend income $ 868 $ 650\nInterest expense (1,003) (694)\nOther expense, net (258) (203)\nTotal other income/(expense), net $ (393) $ (247)\nNote 5 - Debt\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program.

    "part_1_item_2": "Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.\nQuarterly Highlights\nTotal net sales decreased 5% or $6.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The weakness in foreign currencies contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, which was partially offset by higher net sales of iPad.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Company announced a new iPad, a new iPad Pro® powered by the Apple M2 chip, and a new Apple TV 4K.\nThe Company repurchased $19.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 15\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced, and could in the future experience, disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. During the first quarter of 2023, COVID-related impacts temporarily affected the Company’s primary iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max assembly facility located in Zhengzhou, China. The facility operated at significantly reduced capacity, impacting iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone Pro Max shipments.\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates and currency fluctuations, have direct and indirect impacts on the Company’s business. The Company believes these factors have impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\n2021 Change\nNet sales by reportable segment:\nAmericas $ 49,278 $ 51,496 (4) %\nEurope 27,681 29,749 (7) %\nGreater China 23,905 25,783 (7) %\nJapan 6,755 7,107 (5) %\nRest of Asia Pacific 9,535 9,810 (3) %\nTotal net sales $ 117,154 $ 123,945 (5) %\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services and iPad. The weakness of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on Americas net sales during the first quarter of 2023.\nEurope\nEurope net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 16\nGreater China\nGreater China net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness of the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar. The weakness of the renminbi contributed to lower net sales of iPhone, which was partially offset by higher net sales of iPad.\nJapan\nJapan net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar, which contributed to lower net sales of Services and Mac.\nRest of Asia Pacific\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The weakness in foreign currencies contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, which was partially offset by higher net sales of Services and iPad.\nProducts and Services Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by category for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\n2021 Change\nNet sales by category:\niPhone (1)\n$ 65,775 $ 71,628 (8) %\nMac (1)\n7,735 10,852 (29) %\niPad (1)\n9,396 7,248 30 %\nWearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2)\n13,482 14,701 (8) %\nServices (3)\n20,766 19,516 6 %\nTotal net sales $ 117,154 $ 123,945 (5) %\n(1)Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n(2)Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod mini and accessories.\n(3)Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\niPhone\niPhone net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales from the Company’s new iPhone models launched in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nMac\nMac net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of MacBook Pro®.\niPad\niPad net sales increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to higher net sales of iPad and iPad Air®.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 17\nWearables, Home and Accessories\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of AirPods, partially offset by higher net sales of Watch.\nServices\nServices net sales increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to higher net sales from cloud services, the App Store® and music.\nGross Margin\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\nGross margin:\nProducts $ 35,623 $ 40,120\nServices 14,709 14,123\nTotal gross margin $ 50,332 $ 54,243\nGross margin percentage:\nProducts 37.0 % 38.4 %\nServices 70.8 % 72.4 %\nTotal gross margin percentage 43.0 % 43.8 %\nProducts Gross Margin\nProducts gross margin decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume.\nProducts gross margin percentage decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\nServices Gross Margin\nServices gross margin increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs, partially offset by improved leverage.\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 18\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\nResearch and development $ 7,709 $ 6,306\nPercentage of total net sales 7 % 5 %\nSelling, general and administrative $ 6,607 $ 6,449\nPercentage of total net sales 6 % 5 %\nTotal operating expenses $ 14,316 $ 12,755\nPercentage of total net sales 12 % 10 %\nResearch and Development\nThe growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nThe growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 25,\nProvision for income taxes $ 5,625 $ 6,611\nEffective tax rate 15.8 % 16.0 %\nStatutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 %\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation, and the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to a higher U.S. federal R&D credit, lower state income taxes and a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, largely offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\nThe Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2022 Form 10-K, except for commercial paper and manufacturing purchase obligations.\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.7 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.\nApple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 19\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $55.1 billion, with $54.8 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The share repurchase program (the “Program”) does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract.
